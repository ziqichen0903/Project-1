Introduction
In this project, we will utilize stack and queue to solve graph search problems. Mazes are perfect graphs because mazes can be viewed as being undirected, fully connected graphs.

There are some rooms in a maze, as shown in the figure below.



(1) The left side ">" means an entrance (start node); the right side ">" stands for an exit (finish node).

(2) Letters are rooms; "-" stands for walls; "*" means corners; " " shows tunnels.

 

Program Requirements [30% points]
Input files:
The three input mazes files (maze_1.txt, maze_2.txt, and maze_3.txt) are listed on Canvas: Canvas --> Files-->project1_maze 

 

Two Algorithms
Usually, two graph search algorithms, Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), are broadly utilized to solve mazes. You also need to use STACK and Queue.

 

Output results:
1) Your program implements two algorithms, and the output files should be *. txt files. For example, if your input file is "maze_1.txt", your output files are "maze_1_solution_dfs.txt" and "maze_1_solution_bfs.txt"

2) Your program should travel all rooms. Please do not only travel rooms between the entrance room and exit room.

Your program needs to travel all rooms with step-by-step travel trajectory maps.
You may get tips from the below links:



Note that you do not need to create animations, but you may show some travel trajectory maps in a file.

 

Demo and Presentation  [30% points]
Students need to demo his/her program and results via a recorded video. The professor or TA may independently verify your codes and results.

 

Project Report [40% points]
A well-written project report. The reports should consist of detailed steps, such as descriptions, screenshots, camera images, etc. Also, the report should have an abstract, introduction, main contexts, conclusion, references, team member contributions, team member list, attached source codes, a recorded video, etc.  

*Presudocode and flowchart are expected.

 

Additional requirements:

1) Each student is expected to submit a team report. In other words, if you do not submit the report before the deadline, you earn a "ZERO" score.

2) The report file name should be "Project_1_YOURNAME". The "YOURNAME" stands for your first name and last name. For example, A student named "Jone Doe" will submit his team report named "Project_1_Jone_Doe".

4) When doing labs, you should capture clearly screenshots to demonstrate your work or implementations. If possible, your screenshots may keep the OS time and date.
